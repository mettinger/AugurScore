        <h1>AugurScore - Evaluating Augur's probability estimates</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>The purpose of this site is to explore the accuracy of the probability estimates generated by Augur.  Every completed trade on Augur can be considered the market's best estimate of the probability for a given outcome.  It is then natural to ask how accurate a set of probability predictions turn out to be when the events are finalized.</li>
           <li>Here is a simple example.  Weather forecasters often say "There is a 70% chance of rain tomorrow."  We would expect that given a large collection of days where the forecast is for a 70% chance of rain the following day, then approximately 70% would indeed experience rainfall on the following day.  Does this expectation turn out to be the case?  In other words, are weather forecasters generating well-calibrated probability estimates?
           <li>We can use data from Augur to explore the quality of market-based probability estimates over a diverse set of events, including sporting events, political events, etc.  The interface allows selecting a subset of events to analyze (for example, only political events).</li>
           <li>In statistics and machine learning "scoring rules" are used to measure the accuracy of probability predictions.  So scoring rules are similar to loss functions in machine learning.  On this site we evaluate several scoring rules on Augur probability predictions.  For a brief overview of scoring rules, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule">Wikipedia article.</a></li>
           <li>Probabilities for outcomes change over time.  For example, predictions seven days in advance are presumably less accurate than predictions one day in advance.  We allow the user to specify the timeframe.</li>
           <li>Kernel functions.</li>
           <li>At the moment, AugurScore only supports analysis on Yes/No markets.</li>
           <li>Technical details:  We use the Augur API (augur.js) to pull the data from an Augur Node.  Then we use Python to process the data.  This website is written in Python with Flask.</li>
